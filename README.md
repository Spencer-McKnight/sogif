# Strategy
The key intention is to convert traffic into prospective investors for a campaign that will run until the fund is closed to new investment in June 2026.
Convey trust rationale through naturally viewable and multi-faceted signalling, such as property profiles, data visualisations, team introductions, portal showcases, and other strategised methods.
Meaningfully bifurcate the experience between convincing entry paths for the prospective investor, and insights for the existing.

There are vital three funnels with which we can convert a prospective user:
1. Register interest form (email)
2. Online investment application
3. Offline investment application (unpreferred alternative fallback)

There are three areas of concern for a existing investor:
1. What is happening to my money within the SOGIF fund?
- Performance statistics
- Information about current property acquisitions
- Property exit breakdowns and understanding rationale
- Announcements and updates that are investor-only (may be different to public)
- Frequently asked questions
- Contact methods
2. How do I invest more or withdraw?
- When investors clearly visualise their exit pathways, it reduces perieved risk of being unable to withdraw money.
- Pointing existing investors to their reinvestment pathway reduces the barrier to entry for reinvestment in the fund.
3. Will this continue to be a trustworthy and positive cashflow benefit?

The investor portal is being provided by a SaaS product called Titanium portal.sogif.au, so only the frontend shall be curated here.
