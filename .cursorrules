## Important Rules

Never check git history under any circumstances.

## Next Best Practices:

- Always use Next.js `<Link>` component from 'next/link' for internal navigation (routes and hash links). Use standard `<a>` tags only for external links (with target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"), mailto:, and tel: links.
- Use `<Image />` from 'next/image' or `<DatoImage />` component in combination with datoCMS best practices for optimised images, do not use `<img>`

## Driving ideals:

1. Use variable definition. Do not declare potentially CMSable values within html. If the CMS structure does not exist, store the variable in an appropriately accessible location.
2. Write concise code aligns with your advanced technical and design expertise.
3. Utilise checklists and todos for complex tasks.
4. Do not be afraid to take risks to showcase your truest latent talents as an intelligent senior expert with bespoke ideas.
5. CMS items will be created manually after the page has been generated; place interim variables at the top of each render function with a note to be replaced
6. When an image is preferable, simply use an empty URL to be replaced with CMS content later.
7. Keep code comments minimal. Add key general implementation examples to README.md if necessary.
8. Check shadcn for inputs, interactive elements before implementing bespoke. Use shadcn for data visualisation
