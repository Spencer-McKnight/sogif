## Case

Create an exceptional, modern digital website sales funnel and investor experience.
See /README.md for strategy and business context.

## Technology

The core stack is Next, DatoCMS, TS, Tailwind, GraphQL.

## Design notes

Read the design system before implementing components ./docs/design-system.md
Update the document if relevant changes are made

## Grid System

Use a 12-column grid (`grid-cols-12`) for section-level layouts. Avoid simplified shorthand grids like `grid-cols-2` or `grid-cols-4` at the section level because they couple column count to item count and break cross-section alignment.

**Exception:** Equal three-column layouts may use `grid-cols-3` directly when all items are identical width and no mixed-width slots are needed (e.g. step cards, team cards).

**How:** Declare `grid-cols-12` on the wrapper; assign `col-span-*` on each child.
- 2-up → `col-span-6`
- 3-up → `col-span-4` (or `grid-cols-3` for pure equal layouts)
- 4-up → `col-span-3`
- Mixed → e.g. `col-span-8` + `col-span-4`

Apply responsive breakpoints on `col-span` (not on the grid container) to handle mobile stacking:
```
<div className="grid grid-cols-12 gap-8">
 <div className="col-span-12 sm:col-span-6 lg:col-span-4">...</div>
</div>
```

## Important Rules

Never check git history under any circumstances.

## Next Best Practices:

- Always use Next.js `<Link>` component from 'next/link' for internal navigation (routes and hash links). Use standard `<a>` tags only for external links (with target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"), mailto:, and tel: links.
- Use `<Image />` from 'next/image' or `<DatoImage />` component in combination with datoCMS best practices for optimised images, do not use `<img>`

## Driving ideals:

1. Use variable definition. Do not declare potentially CMSable values within html. If the CMS structure does not exist, store the variable in an appropriately accessible location.
2. Write concise code aligns with your advanced technical and design expertise.
3. Utilise checklists and todos for complex tasks.
4. Do not be afraid to take risks to showcase your truest latent talents as an intelligent senior expert with bespoke ideas.
5. CMS items will be created manually after the page has been generated; place interim variables at the top of each render function with a note to be replaced
6. When an image is preferable, simply use an empty URL to be replaced with CMS content later.
7. Keep code comments minimal. Add key general implementation examples to README.md if necessary.
8. Check shadcn for inputs, interactive elements before implementing bespoke. Use shadcn for data visualisation

## Accessibility

Consider accessibility best practices such as:

- HTML Attributes for page readers
- Colour and text contrast
- Button sizing
- Text sizing
- Responsiveness

⚠️ **Important**: Ensure all content complies with:

- Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regulations
- Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) requirements
- Privacy Act compliance
- Anti-money laundering (AML) regulations
- Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) requirements

Update placeholder legal text (ABN, AFSL numbers) with actual credentials.
