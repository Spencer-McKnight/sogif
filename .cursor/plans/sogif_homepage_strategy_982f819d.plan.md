# SOGIF Homepage Structure Analysis and Recommendations

## Competitor Landscape Analysis

### Tier 1: Global Fund Leaders

| Platform | Strategy | Key Insight for SOGIF |

|----------|----------|----------------------|

| **Vanguard AU** | Goal-based navigation | "Which goal can you check off?" reduces choice paralysis |

| **Wealthfront** | Performance-transparency first | Bold metrics above fold build immediate trust |

| **M1 Finance** | Platform sophistication | "Sophisticated wealth building, simplified" messaging |

| **Endowus** | Intent-based selectors | "I'm looking to..." segments by risk/reward profile |

### Tier 2: Thesis-Driven Boutiques

| Platform | Strategy | Key Insight for SOGIF |

|----------|----------|----------------------|

| **July Fund** | Research-heavy authority | Investment thesis as the hero, attracts sophisticated investors |

---

## Critical SOGIF Differentiators to Leverage

1. **Urgency Factor**: Fund closing June 2026 creates natural scarcity
2. **Tangible Assets**: Property portfolio provides visual trust signals (unlike abstract equity funds)
3. **Track Record**: 8.3% cumulative return, $130M+ invested, quarterly distributions
4. **Australian Focus**: ASIC-regulated, domestic compliance = simplified trust narrative

---

## Recommended Hero Journey: "Dual-Path Trust Architecture"

Rather than a single hero journey, I recommend a **bifurcated experience** that your strategy document identifies as essential (prospective vs existing investors). This is the Wealthfront "sophistication split" adapted for SOGIF's specific audience:

```
+------------------------------------------+
|              SOGIF Hero                   |
|  "Strategic Property Returns, Simplified" |
|                                          |
|  [Prospective: "Start Investing"]        |
|  [Existing: "Investor Login →"]          |
+------------------------------------------+
            |
    +-------+-------+
    |               |
    v               v
 NEW INVESTOR    EXISTING
 JOURNEY         INVESTOR PATH
```

## Proposed Homepage Structure (Improved)

### Section 1: Hero (The Hook)

**Headline**: Strategic Property Returns. Quarterly Income. Expert Management.

**Sub-headline**: Access Australia's diversified growth and income fund with $130M+ invested and 8.3% historical returns.*

**Primary CTA**: "Register Interest" (captures leads before full commitment)

**Secondary CTA**: "Investor Portal →" (existing investor path)

**Micro-copy**: "Closing to new investment June 2026"

*Rationale*: Creates urgency, uses social proof (AUM), and immediately bifurcates the audience.

---

### Section 2: Trust Metrics Strip (The Proof)

A horizontal bar with 4 key figures:

| Metric | Value | Purpose |

|--------|-------|---------|

| Historical Return | 8.3%* | Performance proof |

| Assets Invested | $130M+ | Social proof / scale |

| Min. Investment | $10,000 | Qualification filter |

| Distributions | Quarterly | Income appeal |

*Rationale*: Competitors like Wealthfront and Endowus show this "at a glance" data immediately to build credibility without requiring scrolling.

---

### Section 3: Property Portfolio (The Tangible Difference)

Unlike abstract equity funds, SOGIF can showcase **real assets**. This is a massive UX advantage.

- Interactive property cards with location, type, acquisition date
- Map visualization showing geographic diversification
- "Exit Success" highlights showing realized returns

*Rationale*: Property provides visual trust that stock-based funds cannot replicate.

---

### Section 4: Leadership Team (The Human Element)

Brief team cards with:

- Photo + Name + Role
- One-line credential (e.g., "Chartered Accountant, 25+ years")
- Link to full bio

*Rationale*: Steve McKnight's public profile (200k+ book sales) is an underutilized trust asset.

---

### Section 5: Performance Visualization (The Evidence)

- NTA growth chart (interactive, using existing historical data)
- Distribution timeline showing quarterly payouts
- Toggle: "Cumulative vs Annualized" view

*Rationale*: Wealthfront's "show, don't tell" approach to performance data reduces skepticism.

---

### Section 6: How to Invest (The Process)

Three-step visual:

1. **Register Interest** → Receive information pack
2. **Review PDS** → Understand the fund structure
3. **Invest Online** → Complete application in minutes

*Rationale*: Vanguard's "invest in 5 minutes" micro-copy reduces perceived friction.

---

### Section 7: Register Interest Form (The Capture)

- Minimal fields: Name, Email, Investment amount range
- Above-field copy: "Be the first to receive updates and the latest PDS"
- ASIC disclaimer in small print

*Rationale*: This is your primary conversion funnel. Keep friction extremely low.

---

### Section 8: FAQs (The Objection Handler)

Collapsible accordion with 5-7 key questions:

- "What happens to my investment if I need to withdraw?"
- "How are distributions calculated?"
- "What are the fund's fees?"

*Rationale*: Addresses the three existing investor concerns you identified in README.md.

---

### Section 9: Regulatory Trust Footer (The Safety Net)

- ASIC registration badge / ARSN number prominently displayed
- Responsible Entity details (Plantation Capital Limited)
- AFSL number (339481)
- Link to PDS and TMD documents

*Rationale*: Australian regulatory trust signals are essential for retail investor conversion.

---

## Alternative Hero Journeys to Consider

### Option A: Intent-First (Endowus Model)

Replace the static hero with a "selector":

- "I want to **grow my wealth** over time"
- "I want to **generate passive income** quarterly"
- "I want to **diversify** into property without direct ownership"

*Best for*: Higher engagement, but may slow down users who already know what they want.

### Option B: Urgency-Led (Scarcity Model)

Hero focuses entirely on the June 2026 close:

- Headline: "Final Window: Strategic Property Returns"
- Countdown timer or "X spots remaining" indicator

*Best for*: Maximum conversion pressure, but may feel too "salesy" for regulated finance.

### Option C: Performance-First (Wealthfront Model)

Hero shows a live/static performance chart with the 8.3% return prominently:

- Headline: "8.3% Historical Returns. Zero Complexity."
- CTA: "See How It Works"

*Best for*: Data-driven investors who want proof before exploring.

## Key UX Improvements Over Your Initial Structure

| Your Initial | Recommended Change | Rationale |

|--------------|-------------------|-----------|

| Hero | Add urgency micro-copy + dual CTA | Bifurcates audience immediately |

| Property Portfolio | Add interactive map + exit highlights | Leverages SOGIF's tangible asset advantage |

| Team | Lead with Steve's public credibility | Underutilized trust asset |

| Performance | Interactive chart with toggle | "Show, don't tell" approach |

| How to Invest | Simplify to 3 visual steps | Reduces perceived friction |

| Register Interest | Move higher in hierarchy | Primary conversion funnel should be prominent |

| FAQs | Frame as objection handlers | Addresses withdrawal/trust concerns |

---

## Compliance Note

All performance claims must include ASIC-compliant disclaimers (past performance not indicative of future results). The "8.3% historical return" should reference the specific calculation methodology in footnotes.

---

## Next Steps

1. Confirm preferred hero journey approach (Dual-Path, Intent-First, Urgency-Led, or Performance-First)
2. Define the priority weighting between prospective vs existing investor UX
3. Finalize section order based on conversion funnel priority
